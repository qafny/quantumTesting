  "description": "Circuit to solve the hidden linear function problem.\n\n    The 2D Hidden Linear Function problem is determined by a 2D adjacency\n    matrix A, where only elements that are nearest-neighbor on a grid have\n    non-zero entries. Each row/column corresponds to one binary variable\n    :math:`x_i`.\n\n    The hidden linear function problem is as follows:\n\n    Consider the quadratic form\n\n    .. math::\n\n        q(x) = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}{x_i x_j} ~(\\mathrm{mod}~ 4)\n\n    and restrict :math:`q(x)` onto the nullspace of A. This results in a linear\n    function.\n\n    .. math::\n\n        2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{z_i x_i} ~(\\mathrm{mod}~ 4)  \\forall  x \\in \\mathrm{Ker}(A)\n\n    and the goal is to recover this linear function (equivalently a vector\n    :math:`[z_0, ..., z_{n-1}]`). There can be multiple solutions.\n\n    In [1] it is shown that the present circuit solves this problem\n    on a quantum computer in constant depth, whereas any corresponding\n    solution on a classical computer would require circuits that grow\n    logarithmically with :math:`n`. Thus this circuit is an example\n    of quantum advantage with shallow circuits.\n\n    Reference Circuit:\n\n    .. plot::\n        :alt: Diagram illustrating the previously described circuit.\n\n        from qiskit.circuit.library import HiddenLinearFunction\n        from qiskit.visualization.library import _generate_circuit_library_visualization\n        A = [[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]]\n        circuit = HiddenLinearFunction(A)\n        _generate_circuit_library_visualization(circuit)\n\n    References:\n\n    [1] S.
