  "description": "The real-amplitudes 2-local circuit.\n\n    The ``RealAmplitudes`` circuit is a heuristic trial wave function used as Ansatz in chemistry\n    applications or classification circuits in machine learning. The circuit consists of\n    alternating layers of :math:`Y` rotations and :math:`CX` entanglements. The entanglement\n    pattern can be user-defined or selected from a predefined set.\n    It is called ``RealAmplitudes`` since the prepared quantum states will only have\n    real amplitudes, the compl",
