  "description": "Quantum Fourier Transform Circuit.\n\n    The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on :math:`n` qubits is the operation\n\n    .. math::\n\n        |j\\rangle \\mapsto \\frac{1}{2^{n/2}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} e^{2\\pi ijk / 2^n} |k\\rangle\n\n    The circuit that implements this transformation can be implemented using Hadamard gates\n    on each qubit, a series of controlled-U1 (or Z, depending on the phase) gates and a\n    layer of Swap gates. The layer of Swap gates can in principle be dropped if the QFT appears\n",
