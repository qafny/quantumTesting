  "description": "The hardware efficient SU(2) 2-local circuit.\n\n    The ``EfficientSU2`` circuit consists of layers of single qubit operations spanned by SU(2)\n    and :math:`CX` entanglements. This is a heuristic pattern that can be used to prepare trial wave\n    functions for variational quantum algorithms or classification circuit for machine learning.\n\n    SU(2) stands for special unitary group of degree 2, its elements are :math:`2 \\times 2`\n    unitary matrices with determinant 1, such as the Pauli rotatio",
