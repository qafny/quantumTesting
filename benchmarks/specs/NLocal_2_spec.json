  "description": "The n-local circuit class.\n\n    The structure of the n-local circuit are alternating rotation and entanglement layers.\n    In both layers, parameterized circuit-blocks act on the circuit in a defined way.\n    In the rotation layer, the blocks are applied stacked on top of each other, while in the\n    entanglement layer according to the ``entanglement`` strategy.\n    The circuit blocks can have arbitrary sizes (smaller equal to the number of qubits in the\n    circuit). Each layer is repeated ``re",
