  "description": "Quantum Fourier Transform Circuit.\n\n    The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on :math:`n` qubits is the operation\n\n    .. math::\n\n        |j\\rangle \\mapsto \\frac{1}{2^{n/2}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} e^{2\\pi ijk / 2^n} |k\\rangle\n\n    The circuit that implements this transformation can be implemented using Hadamard gates\n    on each qubit, a series of controlled-U1 (or Z, depending on the phase) gates and a\n    layer of Swap gates. The layer of Swap gates can in principle be dropped if the QFT appears\n    at the end of the circuit, since then the re-ordering can be done classically. They\n    can be turned off using the ``do_swaps`` attribute.\n\n    For 4 qubits, the circuit that implements this transformation is:\n\n    .. plot::\n       :alt: Diagram illustrating the previously described circuit.\n\n       from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT\n       from qiskit.visualization.library import _generate_circuit_library_visualization\n       circuit = QFT(4)\n       _generate_circuit_library_visualization(circuit)\n\n    The inverse QFT can be obtained by calling the ``inverse`` method on this class.\n    The respective circuit diagram is:\n\n    .. plot::\n       :alt: Diagram illustrating the previously described circuit.\n\n       from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT\n       from qiskit.visualization.library import _generate_circuit_library_visualization\n       circuit = QFT(4).inverse()\n       _generate_circuit_library_visualization(circuit)\n\n    One method to reduce circuit depth is to implement the QFT approximately by ignoring\n    controlled-phase rotations where the angle is beneath a threshold. This is discussed\n    in more detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601018 or\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403071.\n\n    Here, this can be adjusted using the ``approximation_degree`` attribute: the smallest\n    ``approximation_degree`` rotation angles are dropped from the QFT. For instance, a QFT\n    on 5 qubits with approximation degree 2 yields (the barriers are dropped in this example):\n\n    .. plot::\n       :alt: Diagram illustrating the previously described circuit.\n\n       from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT\n       from qiskit.visualization.library import _generate_circuit_library_visualization\n       circuit = QFT(5, approximation_degree=2)\n       _generate_circuit_library_visualization(circuit)\n\n    ",
