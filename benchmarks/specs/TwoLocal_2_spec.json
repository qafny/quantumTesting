  "description": "The two-local circuit.\n\n    The two-local circuit is a parameterized circuit consisting of alternating rotation layers and\n    entanglement layers. The rotation layers are single qubit gates applied on all qubits.\n    The entanglement layer uses two-qubit gates to entangle the qubits according to a strategy set\n    using ``entanglement``. Both the rotation and entanglement gates can be specified as\n    string (e.g. ``'ry'`` or ``'cx'``), as gate-type (e.g. ``RYGate`` or ``CXGate``) or\n    as Qua",
